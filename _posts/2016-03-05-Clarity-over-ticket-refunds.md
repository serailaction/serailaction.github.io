## How do refunds work?

As many of you know, I was in hospital for unexpected emergency surgery at the end of January.

I had a season ticket bought until early March when I was expecting to go away - there's no point buying an annual ticket.

So...whilst stuck in hospital, and enjoying the fact I wouldn't have to take a Southeastern service, I was thining...surely I can get a refund?


## What Southeastern say

Here's screen captures from their website:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/refund-ser-2.png" alt="refund-2" style="width: 100%;"/>

Let's see:

- "calculated from the date you hand the ticket in"

- "unable to travel through illness for a minimum of four continuous unbroken weeks." - and a refund of half the weekly cost during that time

So I was resigned to getting around £100 back - I didn't need the ticket to run until March 11th as I was told to work from home, and if I went to the office only for a few days a week - so a season ticket was useless to me.

## The day before visiting the ticket office

I thought I'll check the National Rail Conditions of Carriage, cos surely what Southeastern were offering was unfair for those who had unplanned illness.

It was not only unfair. But wrong.

Here's the NR site:

So as long as I had proof that I was in hospital, it would be backdated to that date, and the rest of the ticket refunded.

Result.

Especially as the NR Conditions of Carriage form part of my ticket contract

## Getting the refund

I went along to Dartford station and was told refunds could only be done by letter.

I pointed out their own website, and said that it said I can go to a station.

I also brought with me copies of my medical paperwork, and a printout of that page from the NR CoC.

One phone call later, and a queue forming behind me, it was resolved and I received my refund of £288 today

## Can Southeastern do better?

Of course they could.

They could be clearer about the rights of passengers that have bought season tickets who have got ill.

The last thing someone wants is to have to battle for a service that they weren't using, on top of the 'service' that they'd get when they do travel.

And Southeastern should tell the truth on their Ticket FAQs or passsengers may think they weren't entitled to a refund, as many of us wouldn't think of looking on the National Rail site.

In summary: 

<b>Southeastern: do better, and put clear, correct, information on your site.</b> People recovering from illness/surgery don't need to have to go through hoops to get what they're entitled to.
