{% include JB/setup %}

If you'd like a template letter/email to work from, I include a generic version of what I sent to my MP, Gareth Johnson, about my concerns for how the Southeastern rail franchise has been specified and how Govia are being rewarded for, what is in our eyes, a failure.

For full transparency I have included a copy of the letter that I sent to my MP after the template.

Please write to your MP if you can spare the time!

If you need contact details then [this site](https://www.writetothem.com) is a great source of information to get details about your MP and councillors and send a message to them.

## Template letter

Hi (Your MP’s name),

With the Department for Transport finally revealing the franchise performance data for Southeastern (see http://serailaction.uk/2016-04-21-Southeastern-performance-data.html), I write this email to ask that, as my MP, you stand up for the rail users in your constituency to ensure that the service isn’t further depleted, whilst Govia profit from meeting the ‘tough targets’ that Claire Perry lauded over us in September 2014.

It is unbelievable, that while, in the last 12 months, Southeastern have not met any of the Public Performance Measure targets, they have met (and very easily in some cases) the targets laid down to them by the DfT - and been awarded financially for doing so.

This will surely only lead to continued complacency from Govia in the way that they treat rail users - focussing on meeting these targets for profit, whilst the hardworking people you represent suffer, many of which just want to get to work on time, and home in the evenings to their families.

Given, what has turned out to be, the weak targets set out by the DfT, versus the ‘tough targets’ sold to us by MP Claire Perry, I ask that:

- You can commit to holding Southeastern to account, listening to your constituents, and raising these concerns to both Govia and the Department for Transport
- You find a way to be involved in how the next franchise in 2018 is specified - taking into account the needs of your constituents
- You challenge the DfT for lying to the people you represent and the Southeastern franchise that ‘tough targets’ are in place - while we continue to see PPM targets not met, and a continuing decline in the rail service

I look forward to hearing your views on this matter.

Regards,


## What I sent to my MP


Hi Gareth,

With the Department for Transport finally revealing the franchise performance data for Southeastern (see http://serailaction.uk/2016-04-21-Southeastern-performance-data.html), I write this email to ask that, as my MP, you stand up for the rail users in Dartford to ensure that the service isn’t further depleted, whilst Govia profit from meeting the ‘tough targets’ that Claire Perry lauded over us in September 2014.

It is unbelievable, that while, in the last 12 months, Southeastern have not met any of the Public Performance Measure targets, they have met (and very easily in some cases) the targets laid down to them by the DfT - and been awarded financially for doing so.

This will surely only lead to continued complacency from Govia in the way that they treat rail users - focussing on meeting these targets for profit, whilst the hardworking people of Dartford suffer, many of which just want to get to work on time, and home in the evenings to their families.

Given, what has turned out to be, the weak targets set out by the DfT, versus the ‘tough targets’ sold to us by MP Claire Perry, I ask that:

- You can commit to holding Southeastern to account, listening to your constituents, and raising these concerns to both Govia and the Department for Transport
- You find a way to be involved in how the next franchise in 2018 is specified - taking into account the needs of your constituents
- You challenge the DfT for lying to the people of Dartford and the Southeastern franchise that ‘tough targets’ are in place - while we continue to see PPM targets not met, and a continuing decline in the rail service

As always, I am happy to meet to discuss Southeastern at a time that we can both make - I realise that this is difficult, but hope that we can discuss this with both my Dartford Rail Travellers’ Association hat on (together with Mike Pellatt), and also as the founder of Southeastern Railway Action Group.

Regards,

Phil Rogers
