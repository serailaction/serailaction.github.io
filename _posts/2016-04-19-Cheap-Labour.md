I first wrote about the Southeastern Apprenticeship scheme on my personal blog [here](http://philrogers.me/0828a)  - last August

Today I took a look at Southeastern's career site and found a new Apprentice job...

SPLIT_HERE

## Come work for us...

It's ['Business Apprentice'](https://www.southeasternrailwaycareers.co.uk/templates/Southeastern_Railway/jobdetail.aspx?raparam=4C6A5951444B715443686A6F555364326A3450454B6B6B792B66344339657762).  Wow that sounds like a good job, doesn't it?>

It goes on to describe the role:

>The role provides day to day business and administrative support to the Recruitment Team.  The administrative requirements include a full range of office duties and customer facing services.  Supervised development in business and administration duties is part of the job and time is allocated within working hours, for completion of study as agreed by the Recruitment Manager.

So, an office admin person?

Great.

For £3.57 an hour.

## The detailed job description (from the detailed attachment)

## So they want a receptionist/PA/admin person

FOR £3.57 AN HOUR

## Profit has to come from somewhere

They're already decimating the service with a deteriorating 'Public Performance Measure' that affects rail users daily.

I guess being able to pay an Office Admin £3.57/hour under the Apprentice scheme is another way to boost their profits.

However, that's a little bit rich for a company that helped one of their parent companies return a £25+m profit last year.

Southeastern should be properly recompensing those who want a job, instead of taking advantage of them.

As they take advantage of us.

Daily.

Come on Southeastern, Govia, Keolis, Go-Ahead Group, and Managing Director David Statham - do better for those that interact with you.
