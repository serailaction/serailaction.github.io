We're having a meeting with Southeastern Managaging Director, David Statham, and some of his team.

Here's what we have on our list to cover - if you have anything to add then let us know via Facebook or Twitter!

## Outstanding questions

Here's what we currently have ou tstanding

### 22nd October 2015 - Heating question

>Work continues on our project to relocate heating thermostats onboard, as a direct result of passenger feedback, to improve temperature regulation and our drivers are informed that heating should be switched off onboard during the peak on Class 465 units.

I questioned what turning off heating during peak meant.

As we all know, the heat on the Class 465 network trains reaches unbearable temperatures, even during winter.

5 months on, we do not have an answer to this question

### Turning off rail problem alerts

14th October - via twitter, JT said he'd asked MG to write to me to explain the rationale for changing alerts.

I've received nothing since then, and for several months, no alerts from the new alerts provider...


### Ongoing heating problem on networkers during winter

This has been covered here: https://www.drta.org.uk/127/its-time-to-stoptheroasting/

### Bikes on trains at Dartford

This is an ongoing problem, we're constantly told that the station manager will be told, but nothing happens



### Responses to ongoing campaigns

Reports of flashing signs on board trains, but no update - this started happening again late in 2015. What's going on?

No clear restart date for #stoptheheating

Calls for heating to be turned down during winter have fallen on deaf ears. Whilst too cold can be solved by adding layers of clothing, the excessive heating inches from customer's legs and belongs could potentially be dangerous.
