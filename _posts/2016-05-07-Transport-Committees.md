There are a couple of Transport Committee Inquiries into rail related areas at the moment.  If you can spare some time over the next few days then please make your voices heard

They are:

[Improving the rail passenger experience inquiry](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/transport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/improving-the-rail-passenger-experience/)

[Rail franchising inquiry](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/transport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/rail-franchising-15-16/)

Be sure to read the 'Terms of reference' for each in the 'Scope of the inquiry box'

## How to provide your feedback

[Guidelines can be found here](http://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/have-your-say/take-part-in-committee-inquiries/commons-witness-guide/)

It should be in Microsoft Word format only (argh!) and contain a summary and your feedback - it's important to look at the subject as a whole, and not target a particular instance - for example, it isn't about complaining that your Delay Repay wasn't paid for a particular journey, or that you didn't receive a notification that your train was cancelled (I think I tweeted enough about the CHX 1801 not been announced on Journeycheck or on SER's twitter last night).

Also note in the guidance that you shouldn't use anything *specifically* prepared for the committee without permission from the clerk of the committee.  So don't post up your response online.

I'm sure you can guess the feedback that I'll be sending them!
