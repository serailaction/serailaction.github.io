I've started a petition on the Government Petitions site to ask for Rail Minister and the DfT to make the performance data available in the public domain after the DfT's refusal to share this under FOI.

Please sign and share with your fellow commuters

SPLIT_HERE

Given the "tough targets" we were promised back in September 2014 when Southeastern were awarded the direct award contract, we should be able to see the performance data so we can see how they have performed against the DfT's "tough targets" and also what action has been taken to safeguard the rail user experience.

We need to keep the pressure on Southeastern and the DfT to not further reduce the service we are experiencing as talk of TfL taking over continues.

Please sign, share and make your MP aware of this and see if you can get them to put pressure on the DfT to reveal this data
