I found this paper whilst looking up the effects of heating on the human body:

<a href="http://jap.physiology.org/content/120/9/1047.long">http://jap.physiology.org/content/120/9/1047.long</a>

Summary is that:

<li>blood will flow up to 4x more than before
<li>core & muscle temperature increased by around 3C

...all from heating ONE leg - and remember that Southeastern's heating exhausts over 60C typically.

## Recommendation

My recommendation is that customers do NOT site next to the windows on networker trains as this could cause adverse effects to health


## Get the message out

Please share this post with your fellow commuters - delays are bad enough, however damaging your health and wellbeing due to Southeastern's continued negligence, and ignoring of the heating issue, shouldn't be something else to add to the list.
