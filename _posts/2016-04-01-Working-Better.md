**A**fter a lot of thought. **P**articularly about how we have written about southeastern in the past. **R**ealistically we believe that it is better to follow the company line from Southeastern. **I**'m not too happy about this but realise this is the best way forward. **L**ook forward to the group followers thoughts on this.

**F**or now we'll keep the group going.

**O**n no account should you unfollow.

**O**nly if you've given up the fight.

**L**et's look towards a better future.
