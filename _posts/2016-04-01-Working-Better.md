After a lot of thought. Particularly about how we have written about southeastern in the past. Realistically we believe that it is better to follow the company line from Southeastern. I'm not too happy about this but realise this is the best way forward. Look forward to the group followers thoughts on this.

For now we'll keep the group going.
